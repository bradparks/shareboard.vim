2.  Add 1-10 ul of DNA, pipette gently to mix
3.  Incubate the cell for 30 min on ice and set 0.5 ml tube incubator at 42 C while waiting
4.  Incubate the cell for 30-60 sec at 42 C and immediately put on ice for 2 min
5.  Transfer all TSS cells to 1-2 ml of SOC at RT
6.  Incubate the cells at 37 C for 1 hour on shaker
7.  Spread 100-300 ul of cells onto a appropriate antibiotic plate. Grow overnight at 37 C
